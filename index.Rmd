## About


> I am research-oriented and very enthusiastic about eduction. I honestly believe that no research question or problem is too complex, and knowledge and research outcomes are meant to be communicated in a simple and engaging way to a wide audience. 
My interests lie in data science, biogeography, macroecology, wildlife conservation, database management, GIS & remote sensing, and web development. 


I love bird watching, reading, learning programming languages, and building websites like this one.
